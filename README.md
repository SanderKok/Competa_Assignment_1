Assignment for Competa IT

Assignment 1 has NO .css with the file linked.
=================================
Assignment 2 does have css with it.
This is still under construction.
=================================
The file "main.css" will not be used anymore.
The new .css file is custom.css and is linked with Assignment_2.html.
custom.css will be edited  with SASS and the name for the SASS file is: "custom.scss".
=================================
My struggles:
1. BEM:
My struggles with BEM were that I had trouble finding and using the right blocks and elements.
2. SASS:
I had problems with the nesting of styles. But after the tutorial, I knew it. So it was for just a bit.
